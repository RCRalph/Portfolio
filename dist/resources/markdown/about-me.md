# Introduction
Hi, my name is Ralph. I live in Cracow, Poland. I've been programming since I was 14 and from that time it was my main passion and favourite thing to do in my free time. 

**I am:** conscientious, economical, punctual, motivated, focused on self-improvement, flexible with my skillset, helpful to others around me and a perfectionist.

# My passions and interests
## Programming
As mentioned above, I've been writing code since I was 14. I started out with **C++** and **Python**, with which I've been learning the basics of how to make software and do it efficiently. After that I learned **HTML**, **CSS**, **JS** and **React**, which I used for **front-end** development. Later I switched to **back-end** development, for which I learned **PHP**, **Laravel**, **Node** and **Express**. While doing projects with Laravel, I felt the need to learn **Webpack** and **Vue**, which in my opinion is the best front-end framework I've ever worked with.

In my spare time I also like doing competitive programming, which I think helps me think about problems that I encounter in the *out-of-the-box* way. I've also learned about things connected to **Dev-Ops**, like **IBM Cloud** or setting up my own **VPS**. I am really excited about how many things I can do in the future, such as learning **Go** and **Django** as well as mastering the skills that I already have by doing more and more projects with them.

Writing clean code is my priotity and that's why I want to learn how to write code so it can be understood by other programmers. The more projects I make, the better my code gets and I take advantage of more and more features of frameworks or libraries.
## Computer hardware
I've been passionate about computer hardware since I can remember. I love fixing things as well as disassembling them into parts and assembling them again, because my goal is to understand how things are made. I do most of the maintenance of my computer myself. It not only helps me save money, but also I think this is a great way to have fun.

Taking apart my laptop for basic dust cleaning was really enjoyable :){.small}

You can talk with me about hardware all day long and you would never get bored. I am the person who you'll ask for recommendation about what computer parts / laptop you should buy in a given budget. I'm also the guy that will always help you with fixing your stuff, from moving an icon on the screen to much more advanced stuff.
## Stock market and finances
Stock market and finances have been my subject of interest for quite some time now. Understanding the mechanisms behind trading as well as being able to make good decisions within a short amount of time while earning some extra money in the process is something I want to learn and master. This has also been the inspiration behind many of my projects.

My portfolio is very diversified, I own many different stock from different markets. I tend to not look at companies from their marketing standpoint, but rather how they are doing financially. I value dividence very much, and if a company pays more than 5% per year, it's enough to make me interested in it and after some market research, if I find out that it is in a good financial state, there is a good chance of me becoming it's shareholder.
## Motorsport
Alongside all that, I love motorsport, especially Formula 1, Formula 2, Formula E. I like Formula 1 because the quality of racing there is the highest in my opinion, as well as the element of strategy makes the show exciting for me.

One of my favourite overtakes - Brazilian GP 2019 <3{.small}

I like both Formula 2 and Formula E for the excitement that it brings to the viewer. The competition in these series is amazing and any team can not only score points, but win as well. I don't remember a single boring race where F2 or FE cars were racing.

And the cars look amazing too! :O{.small}
## Other things I find interesting
My interests also cover engineering, especially rocket science. I love learning how rockets and rocket engines work, what are the challenges of going to space, Moon, Mars and other planets. I'm closely following the Artemis program by NASA and the Starship project by SpaceX.

I also like reading books, playing computer games (but not for too long and only in my free time) and looking at pictures of cute cats :cat: and dogs :dog:.
