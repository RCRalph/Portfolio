The idea behind QuickPay was to create a PayPal clone, but at the end of the day it became a pretty unique project. The user can send to and recieve money from other users, as well as create payment requests and send them to other users. On top of all that, the user can exchange currencies.

This is my first project with Laravel, so it isn't perfect in any way nor using all the potential of Laravel. This project allowed me to see how good Laravel actually is and how much I actually like this framework. This was also my first project where I used Bootstrap.
