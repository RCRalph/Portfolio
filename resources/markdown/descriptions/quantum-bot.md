QuantumBot is a Discord bot designed specifically for events organized by the Quantum AI Foundation.
It offers various commands such as `!schedule` to show the day's schedule, and `!schedule-full` to display the complete schedule of all events.

Integrating a server into QuantumBot involves configuring a `.json` file with essential properties such as event name, server ID, announcement channel ID, language, timezones, schedule, and deadlines.

Configuring timezones in QuantumBot can be done through two methods: using plain text values or timezone information objects.
Timezones can be specified by their names (e.g., **UTC**, **CET**, **PDT**) or through timezone information objects containing customizable aliases.
